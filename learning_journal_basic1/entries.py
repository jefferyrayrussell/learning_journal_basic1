I think one is always a little more attentive when it is your code being reviewed!  The conversation around testing was very helpful.  My take aways were:  think carefully about what you are testing; test not for just positive results and what is expected; test a variety of different types of parameters:  None, long list, 1 item, empty list; tests should be numerous and well thought out."

We both feel that we need to get much more proficient in this area.  I need how to better use fixtures and the other resources available.  The progress on the learning journal is coming very slowly.  I am afraid much of it is going to be left for the weekend.   I was pleased to have the project â€“ election app - I pitched chosen by three other classmates.  It will be great to work with Jeff, Justin, and Crystal."

Each day this week I feel like I am taking one step forward and two steps back in terms of keeping up with assignments.  I am learning, but the pace is brutal.  Thankfully the weekend is near and hopefully I can catch up.  Zack and I continued working on the binary heap and focused on testing.   I am really looking forward to project week."

It was valuable time spent.  So also was the morning professional development session.  There was a mix of new information and timely reminders about strategies for pitch, profile statement, and tech resumes."
